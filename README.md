Object-Detection-using-PyTorch
This project demonstrates object detection using the Faster R-CNN model with PyTorch. Images are converted into tensors, and the model detects objects by applying a threshold. Detected objects are marked with bounding boxes, and their names are displayed alongside the box. To run this project, you will need to install necessary libraries like PyTorch, Torchvision, and OpenCV. After running the detection script, the model processes the input image, identifies objects, and outputs the image with labeled bounding boxes around the detected objects, based on the threshold value set.
